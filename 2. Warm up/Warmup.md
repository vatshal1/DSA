# Warm-up Section

This is the warm-up section of Namaste DSA course where I learn about the fundamentals of JavaScript. It includes topics such as:

- Functions
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Loops
- Nested loops (loop in loop)
- Star patterns
- Solving various questions to strengthen problem-solving skills

Some of the interesting and good questions I found are:

1. Count the Digits of a number.
2. Printing only even numbers in an array.
3. Largest element in an array.
4. Smallest element in an array.
5. Second largest element in an array.
6. Leetcode problem 7 -> Reverse Integer.
7. Leetcode problem 9 -> Palindrome Number.

Feel free to explore these questions and practice to enhance your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals!
Solution of these questions (except leetcode problems) would be in the respective files in this folder only.
