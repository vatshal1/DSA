In this section, there is one lecture on time complexity.In this lecture, I learnt about some concepts like:

- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Most common Time Complexities and their graphs.
  - Constant time complexity, O(1).
  - Logarithmic time complexity, O(log n).
  - Linear time complexity, O(n).
  - Linearithmic time complexity, O(n log n).
  - Quadratic time complexity, O(n^2).
  - Cubic time complexity, O(n^3).
  - Exponential time complexity, O(2^n).
  - Factorial time complexity, O(n!).
- Big O Notation.
- Some of the problems to understand how to calculate time complexity.
